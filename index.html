            </div>
            <p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth's land surfaces, at and below ground level. The cause is the accumulation of solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and soil.</p>

        <h1> Land Pollution</h1>
       
        <p>Land pollution, the deposition of solid or liquid waste materials on land or underground in a manner that can contaminate the soil and groundwater, threaten public health, and cause unsightly conditions and nuisances.

The waste materials that cause land pollution are broadly classified as municipal solid waste (MSW, also called municipal refuse), construction and demolition waste or debris, and hazardous waste. MSW includes nonhazardous garbage, rubbish, and trash from homes, institutions (e.g., schools), commercial establishments, and industrial facilities. </p>

            <h>Causes</h>
            
            <p>The various human activities and also natural factors are the various causes of land pollution. Besides, some of the causes of land pollution are the use of pesticides, agricultural and industrial waste, deforestation, growing urbanization, acid rains, and mining activities. Furthermore, these activities not only cause damage to the soil but also the reason for various human and animal infections and diseases.

                    <h>Effects</h>
            <p>Generally, the material and liquid wastes that are disposed of on land and water cause the contamination of the land as most of the disposed of wastes are not biodegradable but non-biodegradable and toxic. These waste materials causing land pollution can be categorized into three types- municipal solid waste, construction and demolition waste, and hazardous waste

                    <h>Prevention</h>
            <p>Land pollution is one of the major problems that every country is facing in the current scenario. As far as the causes of pollution are concerned, there is a long list of them. From huge garbage heaps to hazardous chemicals, monoculture farming to overgrazing, every single factor affects the health of our soil.

        <h1>Water Pollution</h1>
        <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances which make the water unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, and other activities. Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites</p>

            <h>What is Water Pollution?</h>
            <p>Water pollution, the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. In addition to the release of substances, such as chemicals, trash, or microorganisms, water pollution may also include the release of energy, in the form of radioactivity or heat, into bodies of water.

                    <h>Sources of Water Pollution</h>
            <p>Water bodies can be polluted by a wide variety of substances, including pathogenic microorganisms, putrescible organic waste, fertilizers and plant nutrients, toxic chemicals, sediments, heat, petroleum (oil), and radioactive substances.Water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. A point source is a pipe or channel, such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city sewerage system. A dispersed (or nonpoint) source is a very broad unconfined area from which a variety of pollutants enter the water body, such as the runoff from an agricultural area.

                    <h>Effects of Water Pollution</h>
            <p>Groundwater—water contained in underground geologic formations called aquifers—is a source of drinking water for many people. For example, about half the people in the United States depend on groundwater for their domestic water supply. Although groundwater may appear crystal clear (due to the natural filtration that occurs as it flows slowly through layers of soil), it may still be polluted by dissolved chemicals and by bacteria and viruses </p>

                Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. </p>
